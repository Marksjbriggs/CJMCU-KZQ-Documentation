# CJMCU-KZQ
Documentation for the CJMCU-KZQ board 

I bought some CJMCU-KZQ boards from banggood - and found no documentation.
So I my small free time I make a schematic, compile an optiboot bootloader,
write a boards.txt and make a custom hardware directory for this board.
Now this board is usable with the Arduino IDE.

The board is like an Pro mini board, you need an 
USB to serial adapter.
Please be careful with the cheap FTDI adapters.
a lot of them are fake chips which doesn't work corecct
I tested some adapters with the Silabs CP2102,
they are working fine for me.

You can use this as you want.
I will be happy if you send me a postcard.
In this case ask for my postal address 
via dieter-l-git(at)gmx.de.
