# CJMCU-KZQ
Documentation for the CJMCU-KZQ board 

I bought some CJMCU-KZQ boards from banggood - and found no documentation.
So I my small free time I make a schematic, compile an optiboot bootloader,
write a boards.txt and make a custom hardware directory for this board.

You can use this as you want - I will be happy if you send me a postcard.
In this case ask for my postal address via dieter-l-git@gmx.de.
